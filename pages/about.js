            Hey there, I’m Abiola Adewale!I recently graduated from Göethe
            Universität, Frankfurt with a master’s degree in Linguistics. I have
            always been passionate about how things work. My curiosity on how
            the web and apps work led me into learning programming. My love for
            creativity inspired me to delve into UX Designs. Over the years, I
            have acquired some certifications in Responsive Web Design and UX
            Design Whilst working on some personal projects, I have collaborated
            with some people of like minds to build some projects. I am
            comfortable working with the listed technologies:
            <ul>
              <li>👉 HTML5</li>
              <li>👉 CSS</li>
              <li>👉 Javascript</li>
              <li>👉 React with Next.js</li>
              <li>👉 Styled Components</li>
              <li>👉 Tailwind CSS</li>
              <li>👉 Figma</li>
              <li>👉 Adobe XD</li>
            </ul>
            Other than spending time on computer, I also enjoy playing console
            games like football and some adventures. I am a scrabble expert.
            When I don't go for a walk in the evening, I ride my bike or spend
            time time chilling with friends.
